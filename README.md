## Doing this React/Redux small home assignement app for job opportunity.

1. Used ReactJS + Redux as store
2. Chose Redux Thunks for async actions
3. Wrote in TypeScript
4. Wrote tests for actions, reducers
5. Tests for dumb components I left trivial just to check if component renders and compare to snapshot
6. I am using `react-create-app --typescript` as starter, so ussual `yarn start` and `yarn test` will work.
